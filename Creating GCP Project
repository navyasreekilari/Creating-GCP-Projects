Here, we focus on creating GCP projects, folders and resources and how we use them for resource organization.


Project is stored at lower level resources and logical group.
Any resources you create in Compute engine instances, Cloud storage buckets and cloud sql db should be listed under projects.
Grouping of projects were done in folders.
Only projects that contain resources were other folders.
Folders can also be nested under organization(that is top level of the hirerarchy).

Top to bottom hirerarchy at a company
