# Building and Testing applications on GCP
Building, Testing and deploying application on Google cloud platform 

Here, I am using Python programming language to build my code. (You can use any programming language you are comfortable with, to build your code)
 Need to have basic understanding of Docker and Kubernets.
 
 Main Aim:
 ---> To be familiar with the core services that GCP offers to developers.
 ---> To be able to build a CI/CD pipeline that takes code committed and build, test and deploy application from start to finish.
